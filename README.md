# AR Book Cover 4
 
 Welcome to the AR Book Cover Project. 
 
 The first step would be to clone the project from github to a local folder. This can be done with the git command line command "git clone <url>". 
 Secondly, one needs Unity and Vuforia. Specifically, the Vuforia package must be imported. This is because the file-size was > 100 MB.
