# AR Book Cover 4
 
 Welcome to the AR Book Cover Project. 
 
 The first step would be to clone the project from github to a local folder. This can be done with the git command line command "git clone". 
 Secondly, one needs Unity and Vuforia. Specifically, the Vuforia 8.6.7 package must be imported. This is because the file-size was > 100 MB.  
 
 Unity: unity.com
 Vuforia: https://developer.vuforia.com/ 
 
 Within the Unity Hub, you should first "Add Project", and select the AR Book Cover Folder. Then once Vuforia is imported, click "Play". 
 
 3D models were from Thingiverse for non-commercial use.

 Limitations include the image not being recognized at some horizontal angles of the book. The button on the back needs the book to be front facing the camera to work most effectively.
